#XBL-UI for Unity

Team Vulcan's Xbox Live UI is a single, modular package that allows the developer to easily implement Xbox Live sign in 
to a Team Vulcan Studios game. Just drag and drop the desired prefab into an existing canvas and configure the prefab as necessary. 
Tooltips are on every customizable variable and comments are in the code for easy editing and configuration.

Xbox Live SDK and TextMeshPro are required. The XBL SDK can be found here: https://github.com/microsoft/xbox-live-unity-plugin
TMPro comes pre-installed with Unity and should prompt you to import into the project when you create a TMPro object
